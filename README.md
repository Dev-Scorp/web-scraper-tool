#Welcome to the web scraping extravaganza! With this code, you can easily scrape any web page for its contents. 

To get started, simply follow these steps: 

#1. Import the necessary libraries. This code uses requests and BeautifulSoup to make the scraping process easier. 

#2. Define the function to scrape the web page. This code defines a function called scrape_web() which takes in a URL as an argument 
and returns a list of all the links on that page along with their associated text. 

#3. Call the function with a URL as an argument. Simply call scrape_web() with a valid URL as an argument and it will return all the links on that page 
along with their associated text in a list format. 

#And that's it! You're now ready to start scraping any web page you want!
